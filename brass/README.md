Last year Roxley Games kickstarted a deluxe version of the classic Martin Wallace economic strategy game **Brass**. The deluxe edition was renamed [Brass Lancashire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass-lancashire), and a follow-on game [Brass Birmingham](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham) was also released. Both of these games are beautiful games, but they both use a lot of tiles for each player, and so the games could use a bit more organization than a couple of plastic bags.

The first item I designed was a tray (with lid) that would store all of the tiles and counters for each player. These trays were designed to fit in the larger parts well in the box insert. This well has sculpted corners, so the trays were sculpted to fit the well, for maximum space utilization. There's a separate model for Brass Lancashire and Brass Birmingham, because each game has a different number of tiles. The tray lids have a window so you can see which color tiles are in the box.

The tile trays are intended to be filled in reverse (first tiles used are loaded in the tray first, upside down). When you want to set up the game, open the tray, remove the character tile, then carefully turn the tray upside down and then move the tiles to their correct location on the player board.

The second item was a custom deck box to contain the location and industry cards. I sleeved my cards, so the box needed to large enough to accommodate the sleeved cards. Brass Lancashire has fewer cards than Brass Birmingham, but it also has a plaque that gets stuck into the deck during play, and that can be stored in the deck box as well.

Finally. there are wooden tokens that represent the different types of commodities in each game, and they need trays as well. Lancashire uses a single tray for iron and coal; Birmingham has one for the beer barrels, and one for the iron, coal, and merchant tiles.
