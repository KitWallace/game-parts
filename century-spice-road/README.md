[Century Spice Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road) is a fun game, but the box doesn't do a good job of storing the spice bowls -- you pretty much have to put all the spice cubes back into bags, and try to stuff the bags into the box. My solution to that was to design covers that snap onto the bowls to keep the spice cubes organized.

[Century Eastern Wonders](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242574/century-eastern-wonders) also has spice bowls that need covers, so I added those as well.

You can either print 4 (8) of the blank lids, or 1 each of the named lids. They just snap onto the bowls. If your yellow Turmeric cubes don't fit, you may need to move a couple of cubes into a different bowl.

For folks with access to a multi-head or multi-material printer, I've also generated _multi_ and _names_ models files for each lid. Just pair the appropriate models for your slicer.

**Century Eastern Wonders** has wooden markers for each players boat and trading posts, so I created boxes to hold the markers. Because of the layout of the tray, the boxes are oddly shaped, but fit together if you print two of each set, left and right. I included a plated set of left and right boxes and lids, for your convenience -- print two plates for a full set.

| Part | Use | Qty |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| csp-ew-player-box-left.stl | Left-handed player box | 2 |
| csp-ew-player-lid-left.stl | Left-handed player lid | 2 |
| csp-ew-player-box-right.stl | Right-handed player box | 2 |
| csp-ew-player-lid-right.stl | Right-handed player lid | 2 |
| csp-ew-player-plate.stl | One set of boxes and lids | 2 |
