I got a copy of [The Quacks of Quedlinburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244521/quacks-quedlinburg), so of course I had to design boxes to hold all of the components. Then I received my copy of [The Herb Witches](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/269259/quacks-quedlinburg-herb-witches) expansion, and had to resize everything to fit all of the new components into the original box. Now, everything will just fit without removing the box insert.

| Model | Qty | Description |
| ----- | --- | ----------- |
| quacks-chip-box.stl | 2 | Boxes for Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow ingredients |
| quacks-chip-lid.stl | 2 | Lids for those boxes |
| quacks-misc-box.stl | 1 | Box for the miscellaneous ingredients (Oranges, Black, Purple) |
| quacks-misc-lid.stl | 1 | Lid for the miscellaneous ingredients |
| quacks-mini-box.stl | 7 | 5 player boxes, a Locoweed box, and a Ruby box |
| quacks-mini-lid.stl | 7 | Lids for those boxes |

**Preparation**

1. Wrap the fortune teller cards with Hugo's Amazing Tape (or put them in a small bag).
1. Each player box gets (1) flask, (1) seal, (2) droplets, (1) rat, (1) score marker, (1) pumpkin 1, (1) green 1, (1) white 3, (2) white 2, (5) white 1, and (3) witch pennies (one of each color).
1. The die and the flame marker will fit in with the rubies in a mini box.
1. The Locoweed ingredients go in the last mini box.

**Assembly Order**

If you remove the box insert, then just toss everything in the box however you like. If you want to keep the box insert, then everything will still fit, if you follow these steps:

1. The small boxes will fit at one end of one well on edge.
1. The spell books will take up the rest of the space in that well. 
1. The larger ingredient boxes will stack at one end of the second well.
1. The thinner ingredient box will fit at the other end of the second well.
1. Stack the fortune teller cards and the overflow bowls on top of that box.
1. Add the witches on top of that stack. 
1. If you are lucky enough have the [Wolfgang's Exchange Office](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/264019/quacks-quedlinburg-wolfgangs-exchange-office) expansion (I don't), then those two boards should fit on top of the wells (one each).
1. Place the rule books on top of the box insert.
1. Place the pots and the scoring track on top of the rules, against one side of the box. 
1. Finally, carefully lay the bags on top, as flat as possible, with the drawstrings in the gap left by the pots and score track.

**Notes**

* The miscellaneous ingredients box is thinner than the other two ingredient boxes, and their lids aren't interchangeable, so I suggest printing it in a different color than the other two.
* I printed the player boxes to match the player colors (red, yellow, green, blue, and black).
* I put the spare white chips in a small bag that sits with the spell books, but you might choose to hide it under the box insert.
* I printed these in PETG for temperature resistance, but PLA would work just as well in cooler climates.
