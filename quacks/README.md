I just received my copy of [The Quacks of Quedlinburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244521/quacks-quedlinburg), so of course I had to design boxes to hold all of the components.

| Model | Qty | Description |
| ----- | --- | ----------- |
| quacks-quad-box.stl | 1 | Box for Gems, Orange, Black, and Purple ingredients |
| quacks-chip-box.stl | 2 | Boxes for Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue ingredients |
| quacks-single-lid.stl | 3 | Lids for large boxes |
| quacks-half-box.stl | 4 | Player boxes (print in red, yellow, green, and blue) |
| quacks-half-lid.stl | 4 | Player box lids (print in red, yellow, green, and blue) |

The player boxes will fit in the bottom of one well, with the cards and the bags; the ingredient boxes will fit in the other well, with the spell books.

I printed these in PETG for temperature resistance, but PLA would work just as well in cooler climates.
