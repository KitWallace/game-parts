I like playing [1846: The Race for the Midwest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405/1846-race-midwest), so when I bought a copy for myself, I knew I was going to have to make some organizers for it. I ended up with a set of organizing trays with lids that fit in the original box without removing the box insert. This makes for easy setup and cleanup, and keeps all of the parts organized even if the box is inverted.

The first step was designing trays to hold all of the track tiles. I used two sizes of tray: one that holds up to 5 tiles in a stack, and one that holds up to 2 tiles in a stack. With two of each of these trays, I can hold all of the tiles. The boxes and lids have hexagonal holes so that you can see which trays hold which tiles, and to cut down on plastic used (and print time). I put all of the city track tiles in one of the larger trays, the yellow track tiles (and some of the green tracks) in the second larger tray, and the rest of the green tiles in a smaller tray, and the brown tiles in the last small tray.

The second step was designing boxes to hold the company stock certificates and counters. An extra box can be used to hold the private company and player cards and their miscellaneous counters. Again, the boxes have holes to let you see what companies you need and to reduce materials and print time.

Finally I used some [Hugo's Amazing Tape](https://www.amazingtape.com/) to wrap up the train cards and the money.

Total items to print:

* (2) Tall Tile trays
* (2) Short Tile trays
* (4) Tile tray lids
* (8) Card trays
* (8) Card tray lids

As an experiment, I created a tray to hold just enough poker chips to replace the paper money. This fits in the box if you remove the insert; place the money tray in the bottom of the box, with the card trays and the train cards. Place the player cards above the card trays and train cards, then add the tile trays, map board and rules as above. The tray holds:

* (50) $1 chips
* (20) $5 chips
* (20) $10 chips
* (20) $25 chips
* (20) $50 chips
* (20) $100 chips
* (20) $500 chips
* (10) $1000 chips

Technically, you don't need the $1000 chips, but I had the chips and the space.
