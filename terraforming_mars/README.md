I like to play [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) 
but one of the things that it needs is a marker to indicate which to pass cards when drafting, 
so I designed one.

It's a simple arrow in a circle -- one side is clockwise, the other is counter-clockwise. i
I've got a couple of versions, depending on what appeals to you:

* tm-spinner-hollow -- This is a disk with the arrow cut out of it.
* tm-spinner-inset  -- This is a disk with a recessed arrow on each side. You'll need supports to print it.
* tm-spinner-color1 -- This is the disk, for use as a two-color print.
* tm-spinner-color2 -- This is the arrow, for use as a two-color print.
