I recently acquired a copy of [1867: The Railways of Canada](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227143/1867-railways-canada) from All Aboard Games. As you might expect by now, I put some effort into organizing the game components. I ended up with a set of organizing trays with lids that fit precisely in the original box. This makes for easy setup and cleanup, and keeps all of the parts organized even if the box is inverted.

I believe these trays would also work for [1861: The Railways of the Russian Empire](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23817/1861-railways-russian-empire), since it is largely the same game, in the same size box.

The first step was to design tile trays similar to my previous 18XX trays. 1867 uses laminated card stock for its tiles which are otherwise the same size as 1830 tiles. The 1867 box is larger than my other 18XX games, so it can handle trays that hold 15 stacks of tiles. I ended up with 2 sizes of trays: one that holds up to 10 tiles in a stack, and one that holds up to 5 tiles in a stack, primarily to save material and time when printing. I put all of the yellow tiles into one tall tray (splitting the straight and gentle curve tiles into multiple stacks). Then I put all of the green, brown, and gray tiles with cities or dits into the other tall tray. Finally I loaded all of the remaining track tiles into two short trays, with all of the tiles in numerical sequence.

The second step was to design a tray to hold all of the company tokens. Since there are 8 stock companies (5 tokens each) and 16 minor companies (3 tokens each), I created a tray that has 8 rows that handle 1 stock company and 2 minor companies. Then I added one more row for the 8 tokens for the Canadian National, and the turn order token.

Finally I created a tray that can handle 9 stacks of cards:

* 8 sets of shares for the stock companies, plus the private companies and the priority deal card)
* 9 types of engines

Total items to print:

| 1 | 1867-token-lid.stl | Lid for the token box |

As an experiment, I tried printing card and tile boxes with honeycomb infill and without top or bottom solid layers. This produced a nice effect, but the resulting boxes are too flimsy for my tastes. YMMV.
