After using my original design for several months, I decided to refactor my designs and add some features to improve the usability of the boxes:

1. Rounded boxes -- All of the boxes now use rounded corners and edges that make them more comfortable to use.
1. Locking lids -- All of the boxes now use press-fit lids that are easy to separate, but lock into place, to keep from accidently spilling the tiles.
1. Redesigned hex boxes -- The redesigned hex boxes and lids engage to keep tiles from sliding, but don't interfere with opening or closing the boxes.
1. Redesigned token boxes -- now with fillets in the compartments, for easier access.
1. Smaller boxes -- the newer box designs are easier to remove from the game boxes.
1. Refactored models -- now it's much faster and easier to create designs for new games.

I will leave the old models up for posterity and comparison, but strongly suggest using the newer models.

I recently acquired a copy of [1867: The Railways of Canada](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227143/1867-railways-canada) from All Aboard Games. As you might expect by now, I put some effort into organizing the game components. I ended up with a set of organizing trays with lids that fit precisely in the original box. This makes for easy setup and cleanup, and keeps all of the parts organized even if the box is inverted.

I believe these trays would also work for [1861: The Railways of the Russian Empire](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23817/1861-railways-russian-empire), since it is largely the same game, in the same size box.

The first step was to design tile trays similar to my previous 18XX trays. 1867 uses laminated card stock for its tiles which are otherwise the same size as 1830 tiles. The 1867 box is larger than my other 18XX games, so it can handle trays that hold 15 stacks of tiles. I ended up with 2 sizes of trays: one that holds up to 10 tiles in a stack, and one that holds up to 5 tiles in a stack, primarily to save material and time when printing. I put all of the yellow tiles into one tall tray (splitting the straight and gentle curve tiles into multiple stacks). Then I put all of the green, brown, and gray tiles with cities or dits into the other tall tray. Finally I loaded all of the remaining track tiles into two short trays, with all of the tiles in numerical sequence.

The second step was to design a tray to hold all of the company tokens. Since there are 8 stock companies (5 tokens each) and 16 minor companies (3 tokens each), I created a tray that has 8 rows that handle 1 stock company and 2 minor companies. Then I added one more row for the 8 tokens for the Canadian National, and the turn order token.

The third step was to create a tray that can handle 9 stacks of cards:

* 8 sets of shares for the stock companies, plus the private companies and the priority deal card)
* 9 types of engines

The fourth step was to design a small box to hold the loan and turn order tiles.

Since not everyone has a printer with a 200mm x 250mm bed, I designed some alternative trays that may be more generally useful.  These trays have 4 rows of 4 stacks of tiles and are 7" x 8":

A friend asked me to design a card rack to hold the company stock and engine cards, so I did.
