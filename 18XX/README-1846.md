After using my original design for several months, I decided to refactor my designs and add some features to improve the usability of the boxes:

1. **Rounded boxes** -- All of the boxes now use rounded corners and edges that make them more comfortable to use.
1. **Locking lids** -- All of the boxes now use press-fit lids that are easy to separate, but lock into place, to keep from accidently spilling the tiles.
1. **Redesigned hex boxes** -- The redesigned hex boxes and lids engage to keep tiles from sliding, but don't interfere with opening or closing the boxes.
1. **Redesigned token boxes** -- now with fillets in the compartments, for easier access.
1. **Smaller boxes** -- the newer box designs are easier to remove from the game boxes.
1. **Refactored models** -- now it's much faster and easier to create designs for new games.

I will leave the old models up for posterity and comparison, but strongly suggest using the newer models.

I like playing [1846: The Race for the Midwest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405/1846-race-midwest), so when I bought a copy for myself, I knew I was going to have to make some organizers for it. I ended up with a set of organizing trays with lids that fit in the original box without removing the box insert. This makes for easy setup and cleanup, and keeps all of the parts organized even if the box is inverted.

The first step was designing trays to hold all of the track tiles. I used two sizes of tray: one that holds up to 5 tiles in a stack, and one that holds up to 2 tiles in a stack. With two of each of these trays, I can hold all of the tiles. The boxes and lids have hexagonal holes so that you can see which trays hold which tiles, and to cut down on plastic used (and print time). I put all of the city track tiles in one of the larger trays, the yellow track tiles (and some of the green tracks) in the second larger tray, and the rest of the green tiles in a smaller tray, and the brown tiles in the last small tray.

The second step was designing boxes to hold the company stock certificates and counters. An extra box can be used to hold the private company and player cards and their miscellaneous counters. Again, the boxes have holes to let you see what companies you need and to reduce materials and print time.

Finally I used some [Hugo's Amazing Tape](https://www.amazingtape.com/) to wrap up the train cards and the money.
