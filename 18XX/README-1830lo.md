I ended up acquiring a copy of the new version of [1830](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/421/1830-railways-robber-barons), released in 2018 by Lookout. While this is basically the same game as the Avalon Hill version from 1986, all of the components have been modified to meet modern sensibilities. Consequently, the organizers I made for the [Avalon Hill version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3030638) don't work for this version.

This organizer owes a lot to my organizers for [1846](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2875248), since the new component sizes are closer to that game. I use a separate card box to hold the tokens and shares for each company, and one more card box to hold the round token and all of the other cards. I added a card rack to hold the train cards while playing, since the board doesn't have the train boxes that the original had.
